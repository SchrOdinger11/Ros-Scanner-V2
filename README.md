# Ros-Scanner-V2


Our application is based on Optical Character Recognition has two features first one is extract text and other one is text to speech
converter which is quite useful in these days and is very useful for visually impaired patients
who are having difficulty while reading some text, this application helps them in such a way
they can listen the text written on any paper or article. OCR is using many API’s of google
and so don’t need to train manually a Deep learning model for it This App is also having
Language translation option which helps to overcome the problem of language gap as we can
convert the text into popular regional language of India. Android smartphones are cheaper
than other smartphones and occupy maximum market cap in India, so We have made an android application.
The Level of accuracy to scan characters accurately is based on how much writing is
clear. OCR can read different styles and sizes of text as well as neat handwriting. There is
utmost accuracy in scanning the text with OCR but then also there is the need to check as
some letters are often misread but these cases are very rare.

Here is the flow of the app.
